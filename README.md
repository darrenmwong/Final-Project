Paw-Prints
==========

This was the final project for WDI about making it possible to prevent awareness when a pet will go missing.
The project tracks real time the current locatino of your wifi/GPS and will auto update your cordinates on the map. When you send an alert out of the dog description it alerts every user in that location within a 1/4 mile radius.

Upcoming Features

-Display of where the alert was sent on the map
-Display users updating real time(like waze)
